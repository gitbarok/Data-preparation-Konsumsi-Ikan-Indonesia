# Data Preparation Konsumsi Ikan di Indonesia
This project is for learning about BS4 for reading data in html format, and Pandas for data manipulation, and a little bit of visualisation.

WHY USING BS4?
Because when im download the data from https://statistik.kkp.go.id/home.php?m=aki&i=209, the file came up with xls extension, but inside of the file the data is on html format, so if we using pandas.read_excel, it will error. i need to extract the data 1 by 1 based on html tag using BS4
